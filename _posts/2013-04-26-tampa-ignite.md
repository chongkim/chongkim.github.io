Went to Tampa IGNITE last night.  It started at 6:30pm and I got there late.
Traffic was worse than I expected and I had a hard time parking.  By the time
my wife and I got to the theater, we missed the first third of the
presentations.

I saw Commissioner Sharpe talk about attracting people talented people to
Tampa.  This included fixing downtown so it's easy to get to.  Unfortunately,
his mike went dead in the middle of his talk so he had to speak aloud with no
aid making it difficult to hear.

What struck me about the event was how many people I recognized.  I saw Gavin
Stark and Jason Perry (who won the Kindle raffle) from the Ruby Brigade meetup.
Talked to Ryan (met him at 8th Light talks and at the Hillsborough Hackathon).
Commissioner Sharpe was the presenter who awarded me and my team, PyBulls, with
the first place at the
[Hackathon](http://cltampa.com/dailyloaf/archives/2013/04/15/improving-hillsborough-county-with-a-hack-a-thon#.UXqHfitARbk),
David Sewell of Pivotal Racing and of course everyone from 8th Light.

I like how Tampa is honest with itself that Tampa has problems.  Seems like
there is a movement with this generation to make things better.  I say
generation because these events are just starting.  The Hackathon was the first
one for the county.  Tampa IGNITE was the third one.
