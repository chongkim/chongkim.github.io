I had a problem with my yahoo account for years.  When I signed up for SBC
Global Internet service from ATT, I merged my free account
(chongkim@yahoo.com), which I had for years, with ATT's account.  It was all
well and good until I stopped using ATT.  I was still able to use my free yahoo
account but I was not able to modify my password because it's still linked to
my ATT account.  I wasn't able to go to my ATT account because I don't have
service with them any more.

For years, I was stuck in this limbo.  I googled my problem and saw that other
people had the same problem with no solution.  A couple of weeks ago, my
account was hacked and someone sent spam to everyone on my contact list.
Bummer.  I can't even change my password, so I just removed everyone on my
contact list.

A miracle happened today.  ATT suspended my yahoo account due to inactivity,
and there on the webpage was the button I've been waiting for all this time.
"Unmerge".  I unmerged my free account from ATT and now I'm able to change the
password.  I'm free!!!
