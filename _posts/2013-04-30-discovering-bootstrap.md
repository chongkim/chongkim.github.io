[Alejandra](http://alejandraluaces.com/) mentioned that I should use Bootstrap
to make my site look better.  I few days later I downloaded it.  It wasn't what
I was expecting.  I thought it was going to be a set of programs to generate
CSS, instead it's a set of css, javascript and images. I place those into my
`app/assets` directory.  It made some subtle changes to my site.  It wasn't
noticeable right away, but then I started to notice that my buttons look
different -- there is a gradient.  The font looks a bit better.  It's kinda
nice.  I'm looking around the web to find tutorials to find out how to set up
my site with the right class labels.
