MenuMeters is a free OS X program that allows you to see the current status of
your machine. I've had it for many years. After upgrading to El Capitan, it
stopped working. Yujitach modified the code and now it works.

You can pick it up at
[here](http://member.ipmu.jp/yuji.tachikawa/MenuMetersElCapitan/). It will
install itself into the Preference Pane and display the meters in the menu bars.
