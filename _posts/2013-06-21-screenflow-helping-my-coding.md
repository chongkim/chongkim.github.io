I got [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) a couple of weeks
ago.  At first I wanted to create screencasts where I show something
interesting but then I realized I can use it to better my coding.  When I was
creating the Tic Tac Toe screencast, I made several attempts before I finally
got it down without any serious errors.  Screenflow was really good at showing
me where I went wrong.

On my first attempt, I made an error by forgetting to wrap my RSpec test inside
of a `it` clause.  I managed to continue through and finish the code but I was
on the wrong track.  I thought I called an incorrect matcher.  It wasn't until
I showed it to Meagan when she pointed out that I missed the `it` clause.

Another benefit of using Screenflow is that you can speed up the video by 3.3x
the speed.  You can record yourself programming for the past hour and look back
on what you did.

It might be a good idea to use Screenflow when I'm learning a new language or
installing something for the first time.  I can play it back and see where I
went wrong and I can write a How-To article without having to keep track of my
notes.
