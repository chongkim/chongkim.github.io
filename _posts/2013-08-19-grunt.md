I downloaded the (https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation)[jQuery
Validation plugin) from github and I thought it would be easy to get it
installed.  Usually when I download javascript, I just needed to copy the
javascript files and I'm done.  This time around I was really puzzled.  The
index.html in the demo directory contained this line:

```html
<script src="../dist/jquery.validate.js"></script>
```

but that directory didn't exist.  What is going on?  I looked at the project
root directory and found `Gruntfile` and saw some json files.  After a bit of
googling, I  discovered that grunt is a build system for javascript.

You run

```bash
$ npm install
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-contrib-qunit
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-contrib-compress
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-contrib-jshint
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/grunt
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-contrib-watch
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-contrib-uglify
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-contrib-concat
npm http 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-contrib-qunit
npm http GET https://registry.npmjs.org/grunt-contrib-qunit/-/grunt-contrib-qunit-0.2.2.tgz
...
```

This looks for a file `package.json` which contains a description of the
necessary packages to include much like a `Gemfile` in ruby.

Next, you run `grunt`

```bash
euler:jquery-validation ckim$ grunt
Running "concat:dist" (concat) task
File "dist/jquery.validate.js" created.
File "dist/additional-methods.js" created.

%o has no name assigned [object HTMLInputElement]
....................................................................................................................OK

Done, without errors.
euler:jquery-validation ckim$
```

As you can see the `dist` directory is created and tests were run.  Now you're
all set.  You can copy the files from the `dist` directory and you're ready to
go!
