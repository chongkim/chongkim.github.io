Been learning clojure mainly through reading "Programming Clojure" by Halloway
and Bedra from Pragmatic Programers.  I've been playing around with the REPL
(Read Eval Print Loop).  At first I was using `clj` but `lein repl` is way
better because it allows you to use up/down-arrows to cycle through commands,
tab completions, and be able edit your line.

I found a great [cheat sheet](http://clojure.org/cheatsheet).  I just need to
gather a large enough set of useful commands and I can start coding.  I
probably need a debugger.
